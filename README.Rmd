Leatherwood's Electron Density Orbital Simulator (**LEDOS**) creates pointillist representations of hydrogenic orbitals based on electron density. Each "point" represents a possible location of an electron at any given time in the atom; the darker a point is, the more likely an electron is to be found there. The hydrogen wave function is calculated using the [Boost implementation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/sf_poly/sph_harm.html) of the spherical harmonics in my [**wavefunction**](https://github.com/hmlea/wavefunction) package. A Monte Carlo simulation uses the wave function to choose points where there is a high probability of an electron existing based on the quantum numbers of the orbital. All these points are then plotted using [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R) which results in an electron density cloud that takes on the true shape of the orbital.

Note that before I created the **wavefunction** package, I had implemented the calculations using only native R. However, the calculations were much too slow and it took several minutes to simulate thousands of points for these electron clouds. While it is not a complete package, the set of functions still work to calculate the hydrogen wave function accurately. The [**native-wavefunction**](https://github.com/hmlea/native-wavefunction) project is hosted on my GitHub and can even be used in place of the **wavefunction** package in **LEDOS**.

## Acknowledgements

**LEDOS** was greatly inspired by Alvin Q. Meng and his own project, [Evanescence](https://al2me6.github.io/evanescence) ([GitHub](https://github.com/al2me6/evanescence)). Further, Alvin enthusiastically shared insight into his project and answered many of my technical questions. I wouldn't have been able to create **LEDOS** without his help; please check out his extraordinary project at the link above.

## Usage

**LEDOS** simulates orbital plots in real time using the quantum numbers n, l, and m. On the left-hand selection pane, you can choose quantum numbers that correspond to different orbitals. **LEDOS** will simulate and electron cloud based on the number of points selected and will create an interactive plot in the output pane. The data used to make the plot can be exported as a CSV or and image of the plot can be exported as a PNG.

You can access the web app [here](https://hmlea.shinyapps.io/ledos/) or you can download and run it on your machine using the Shiny package using the following code:

-   `shiny::runGitHub("hmlea/ledos")`

## To Do

In the future, I would like to:

-   Allow the customization of more plot features
-   Add isosurface visualizations
-   Dynamically resize plot with window size
-   Rework the download buttons
-   Allow advanced options to create large data sets
-   Add support for more complex orbitals
-   Improve the simulation progress bar
-   Clean up and refactor general code
-   Rewrite the Monte Carlo simulation in C++
-   Enhance the site design
-   Optimize the $\Psi$ calculation in the **wavefunction** package
